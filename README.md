# Waste-management-system
This is a idea presentation of a project we have been working on. How to maintain the garbage generated in the city and manage it with a few modifications in the existing municipality system.
  The idea is to collect the garbage in a efficient way and use a sorting mechanism, which our team is working on to sort the garbage into metal waste, dry waste and wet waste in the municipality dumping ground. The collection of the garbage takes place in a planned way by a numerous electric cart in a locality which are controlled by a node. The node controls the electric carts and also their maintainence, it also monitors the e-carts using an app.The users can also locate the e-carts by a different configuration of the same app.
  Based on the population of the locality the ward can be a comercial one or a local one for the local ones which produces a moderate amount of waste e-carts are there to collect the garbage but for the commercial areas the e-carts are not enough to cover the entire area due to this the truck which is a full size truck provided by the municipality will do the collection from this areas.the entire process is discussed in vivid manner in the file atttached in this repository.
  The final sorted garbage is then managed by the municipality board as per their policies.
